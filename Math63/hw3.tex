\begin{problem}{1}
    Prove that if the points of a convergent sequence of points in a metric space are reordered, then the new sequence converges to the same limit.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{2}
    Show that if $a_1, a_2, a_3, \cdots$ is a sequence of real numbers that converges to $a$, then, 
    \[\underset{n \to \infty}{lim} \fr{\sum_{n}^{i=1}a_i}{n} = a.\]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{3}
    Prove that any sequence in $\R$ has a monotonic subsequence. 
    
    \emph{(Hint: This is easy if there exists a subsequence with no least term, hence we may suppose that each subsequence has a least term.) (Note that this result and the theorem on the convergence of bounded monotonic sequences gives another proof that $\R$ is complete.)}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{4}
    Let $S$ be a subset of the metric space $E$ . Define the closure of $S$, denoted $\bar{S}$, to be the intersection of all closed subsets of $E$ that contain $S$. Show that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\bar{S} \supset S$, and $S$ is closed if and only if $S=S$. 
        \item $\bar{S}$ is the set of all limits of sequences of points of $S$ that converge in $E.$
        \item a point $p \in E$ is in $S$ if and only if any ball in $E$ of center $p$ contains points of $S$, which is true if and only if $p$ is not an interior point of $S'$ (cf. Prob. 15).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{5}
    Show that a complete subspace of a metric space is a closed subset.
